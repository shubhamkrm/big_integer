# big_integer
This is a C++ library to use very large size integers in a program, just like you use regular integers. It is currently a work in progress and is very limited in scope, but it aims to expand into a Java BigInteger-like implementation, or even better, since it uses operator overloading to mimic normal int-like operations.
